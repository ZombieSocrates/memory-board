# memory-board
As a means to teach myself object-oriented programming, I wanted to build a little library that allows you to play the game memory.
I'm planning to do this with a `MemoryBoard` class that is then imported by another script that allows you to play the game.

Idea for this: I got tired of building the text-based games suggested in [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex45.html),
so I decided to do this instead.

**Python Version**
Originally started doing this on an old Mac running Python 2.6.1.  Doing my best to make it forward-compatible

**Packages Used**
* numpy
* urllib
* math
