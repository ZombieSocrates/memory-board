# memory-board
As a means to teach myself object-oriented programming, I wanted to build a little library that allows you to play the game memory.  I'm planning to do this with a `MemoryBoard` class that is then imported by another script that actually plays the game, keeps track of how many pairs have been successfully guessed, etc. etc.

Idea for this: I got tired of building the text-based games suggested in [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex45.html),
so I decided to do this instead.

**Python Version**  
Originally started doing this on an old Mac running Python 2.6.1.  Switched to using my work laptop on February 28, which runs **Python 3.6.0**

**Packages Used**  
* numpy
* urllib (_would welcome suggestions for better modules that behave similarly across Python 2 and 3_)
* math
